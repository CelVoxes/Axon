- Right now the there is just one flow, where we search for a dataset, and then search, and produce code for that etc.. However, the user should be able to index their files, folders etc to the system and we should be able to act on that as well. For instance, user should be able to select a file with e.g. @data.csv, or a folder with single cell data, and ask the system to act on it. Just analyze this folder or even, search for another dataset to be integrated with their own data.

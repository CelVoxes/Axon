# Auto-Update System

⏺ Perfect! Your auto-update system is now configured to use your custom server at
https://axon.celvox.co/updates/.

Summary of what's implemented:

✅ electron-updater package installed✅ Auto-updater configured in main process✅ Update
checking on app startup (5 seconds delay)✅ Custom server configured for
axon.celvox.co/updates/✅ Update notifications UI component added

To publish updates:

1. Run npm run package
2. Upload files from release/ folder to https://axon.celvox.co/updates/
3. Users will automatically get notified of new versions

The app will now check for updates from your server and show notifications when updates
are available!

We need to update the site, and auto-push when we release a new version.

# SSH into the server

It doesn't work as it suppose to.
